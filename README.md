> Phoney is a ground breaking technology that has the possibility to shape the future. Phoney is unapologetically simple - Steve Jobs 2018

Phoney was created at Glasgow University Hackathon in 42 hours by [Gavin](https://github.com/gavinhenderson), [Dean](https://github.com/beggsington), [Adam](https://github.com/AdamHirst), [Mitchell](https://github.com/mmcjannett), [Conor](https://github.com/ConorHaining), [Jay](https://github.com/jsbennett). See the presentation we gave [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oTnUwLs-fSMAc0JxwIJGvuCfj-Ulkia9eSHVwY87HYE/edit?usp=sharing).

Phoney provides a tool kit to allow call centers to analyse their customers in real time. Calls are being transcribed as they come and you can watch the data mining happening in a real time. The data can then be overviewed by a manager who can look at:
- Average Call Sentiment
- Average Customer emotions
- Common Key words
- Call queue details
